Allow each user to connect multiple devices into a video conferencing room, which will efectively allow them to have a multicam setup. Only ever one of the multicam microphones should be  enabled at any time, and this be dependant on which microphone has the loudest audio levels at the time; thus preventing audio feedback and allowing the user to walk freely between devices.

Use Jitsi as the framework.
